## Development Environment

To set up your development environment, there are a few key requirements you need to meet to ensure consistency and functionality:

1. **Laravel Version:** Make sure you're using the same Laravel version that the package requires or is developed on. This is crucial to prevent potential compatibility issues that might arise from version discrepancies.

2. **DynamoDB Local for Feature Tests:** Our package uses Amazon DynamoDB for certain features, and we require DynamoDB Local for running feature tests locally. Please install and configure DynamoDB Local according to Amazon's official guide. This allows you to test the relevant features in an environment that mimics the production setup without incurring additional costs or network overhead.

3. **Additional Software Requirements:** Be aware of and adhere to any additional software prerequisites or dependencies that the package might have.
